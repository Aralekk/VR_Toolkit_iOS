# VR_Toolkit_iOS

A sample project that provides a basic toolkit to create an interactive VR experience on iOS.
Written in Swift 2.0 using SceneKit.
We added a viewfinder/target so you can aim and select interactive elements like in the Land's End game.
Compatible with all VR viewers.

# For media playback
You'll find here a 360 video player, VR ready, for iOS with methods to play video on an AVPlayer embedded on the materials of a SCNNode
